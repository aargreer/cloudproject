Deployment of a machine learning model to Google App Engine and serving it over HTML

We are using a sample insurance dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/caojingw/health-insurance-prediction) to train a model to predict an insurance quote based on info like age, sex, BMI, smoker or non-smoker, number of children, geographical region, with the goal of deploying to a cloud deployment model
